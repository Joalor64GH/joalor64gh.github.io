A full HTML-based remake of my [website](https://sites.google.com/view/joalor64website-new/)! <br>

## "Why the change?"
Well, the answer is actually pretty simple. <br>
I kind of realized that Google Sites is actually kind of boring and limiting. And while working on Foreverbox, I've mostly been learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so I additionally saw this as an opportunity to learn more to be able to rebuild my website! <br>
And of course, to have full control over it. :trollface:

That's pretty much it, but I hope you enjoy the new website!
