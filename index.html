    <h1>HEY YOU!</h1>
    <h2 id="the-text">I've decided to rebuild my <u><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/joalor64website-new/home">website</a></u> using HTML because Google Sites is actually kind of boring and limiting, and I've mostly spent my time trying to learn HTML, Javascript and CSS while working on Foreverbox. <br><br> So, this could actually be a good opportunity for me to learn some more! <br><br> Honestly, that's really all I have to say, but hope you guys stay tuned for the new website! <br><br><br><br> - Joalor64</h2>
