    <h1>HEY YOU!</h1>
    <h2>I've decided to rebuild my <u><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/joalor64website-new/home">website</a></u>
        using HTML because Google
        Sites is actually kind of boring and limiting, and I've mostly spent my time trying to learn HTML, Javascript
        and CSS while working on Foreverbox. <br><br> So, this could actually be a good opportunity for me to learn some
        more! <br><br> Honestly, that's really all I have to say, but hope you guys stay tuned for the new website!
